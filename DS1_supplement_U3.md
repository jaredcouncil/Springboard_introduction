## Unit 3: Data Wrangling

Sometimes students have find the video online Data Camp exercises difficult to work with. The links below cover the same lessons in a different format, and I offer them for students who are looking for an alternative to the Data Camp material.

### Tidy data

When we talk about *data wrangling*, we mean the process of reorganizing data to make it easier to analyze. Often we find data in formats that were designed to be human-readable, or perhaps easy for data-entry, but not for data analysis. In these cases, we need to transform the structure of the data.

[Section 12.2](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#tidy-data-1) of Hadley Wickham's *R for Data Science* offers some examples of different data formats, and talks about the advantage of *tidy data* for data analysis. Read that section and complete the exercises in 12.2.1. You do not need to read the rest of that chapter.

### Core resources for data wrangling

Chapter 5, [Data transformation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html), of *R for Data Science* covers much of the same material as unit 3.1 in Springboard's *Foundations of Data Science* course. Read that chapter and complete the exercises.

Then finish chapter 12, "[Tidy data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading-and-gathering)," and complete the exercises.

You should now be able to complete the three Springboard mini-projects found in unit 3.1, "Core Resources for Data Wrangling:" "Data Wrangling Exercise 1: Basic Data Manipulation," "Data Wrangling Exercise 2: Dealing with missing values," and the option mini-project, "Data Wrangling Exercise 3: Human Activity Recognition."

## Additional practice

If the three mini-projects leave you wanting a little more practice, give this a try: [A Dirty Dataset for You to Clean](http://rmhogervorst.nl/cleancode/blog/2018/03/12/a-dirty-dataset-for-you-to-clean.html).
