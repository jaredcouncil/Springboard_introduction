# Biography

I'm Jared. I'm a journalist looking to become a data journalist. So I figure learning data-science skills is the best way to make that happen. I've been dealing with numbers and stats for years, and want to be able to better gather/analyze them to tell meaningful and interesting stories. 

# What I hope to gain from this course

Three things I hope to gain from this course are:

1. Learn how data scientists gather/analyze data
2. Coding skills to build vizualizations, as well as automation and suggestion engines
3. An understanding of how machine learning can be useful for the editorial side of journalism

# What challenges I anticipate facing

When I'm learning somthing I love to explore, ponder and test. I call it being "good distracted," as opposed to being bad distracted by things that have nothing to do with the subject matter. So one challenge I expect is being efficient with the 10-15 hours/wk that I have by discerning what's essential for progressing in the course and what's supplementary.

# What strategies I will use to overcome these challenges

Setting reasonable weekly learning/project goals and utilizing hard start/stop times. My daily activities will be building blocks for my weekly goals, so if I get "good distracted," then that's less time I have to make meaningful progress on the course. Those hard time windows can't be extended, which will help me stay focused on what's important.

# My capstone project ideas

Some questions on my mind at the moment include:

* What are the best statistical indicators of success in the NCAA tournament?
* Which S&P 500 firmsâ€™ stock prices are impacted the most by revenue performance?
* Which socioeconomic factors that correlate most with imprisonment rate?
