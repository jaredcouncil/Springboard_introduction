# DS1 Course Supplemental Resources

To help with common questions, I've prepared supplemental material for some of the units.

**[Cheatsheets](Cheatsheets.md)** are a great way to quickly find the functions you need to solve problems. You can find a use for most of these in this course.

**[Unit 1](DS1_supplement_U1.md)**: this page offers links that provide a nice overview of the methods of data science, and some insights and public data sources for your capstone project.

**[Unit 2](DS1_supplement_U2.md)**: Here's a bunch of material that is largely missing from the curriculum, but often trips up students, including understanding different types of data; the assignment operators in R; subsetting data frames and extracting data from them; installing R and RStudio; setting up Git, setting up GitHub and connecting RStudio to GitHub.

*There are also additional practice problems that I ask students attempt at the end of Unit 2.* These optional problems are a good way for you to practice the skills taught in Unit 2, and provide us a chance to improve your proficiency.

**[Unit 3](DS1_supplement_U3.md)** Data Wrangling: Alternative resources for learning data wrangling, with exercises to supplement Data Camp.

<div style="margin-top:10px; margin-left:50px; margin-right:20px; font-style:italic">80% of the time importing data is boring and tedious, and then 20% of the time it's just endless screaming.</div>

**[Unit 6](DS1_supplement_U6.md)**: More on the data story, how to write a technical report, and further resources for presentations.

**[Unit 7](DS1_supplement_U7.md)**: The missing lesson: intro to time series.
